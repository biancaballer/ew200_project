# Meteor Blast
## By Bianca Coleman

Save the planet by blasting any meteors heading its way!

My game incorporates:
keyboard king (key press events)
sound blaster (sound effects based on game events)
points-r-us (track player score)
over achiever (track high score between game plays)
physical (some type of pysics - gravity in space)
shooter (projectiles)
helping hand
shifting screens (multiple screens)
fancy fonts (online font)
the walls are hard (wall collisions constraint player movement)
muzak (continuous music)
great graphics (change sprite based on dynamics)
trick trig (trigonometry for laser trajectory)

Special Thanks to:
